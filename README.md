# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Problem Statement: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Objective:
  To build a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data.

Why is this Important?
  Credit card fraud causes billions of dollars in losses every year.
  Early detection helps banks and financial institutions prevent fraud and protect customers.
  
Challenges in Fraud Detection:
  Highly Imbalanced Data – Fraud cases are rare (~0.17% of total transactions).
  Real-Time Processing – The model should be fast & efficient.
  False Positives vs. False Negatives –
  False Positive: A genuine transaction flagged as fraud → Customer inconvenience.
  False Negative: A fraud transaction missed by the model → Financial loss.
  The model should maximize Recall to avoid missing actual fraud cases.
  
Expected Outcome:
  A classification model that can detect fraud with high accuracy.
  A deployed fraud detection system (API or Web App).
  A documented GitHub repository showcasing the project.
  
Key Business Impact:
  Helps banks prevent financial losses.
  Improves customer security & trust.
  Reduces manual fraud investigation efforts.
  
Step-by-step roadmap for your Credit Card Fraud Detection project.
  Phase 1: Problem Definition & Data Collection
    Step 1: Understand the Problem

    Identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset using ML.
    Handle class imbalance (fraud cases are rare).
    
  Step 2: Get the Dataset

    Use Kaggle’s Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Available here).
    Data has 284,807 transactions, with only ~0.17% fraud cases.
    
Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Step 3: Load & Explore the Data

    Check missing values, duplicates, and data distribution.
    Use Pandas & Seaborn for visualization.
    
  Step 4: Handle Class Imbalance

    Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.
  
  Step 5: Feature Engineering

    Remove highly correlated or unnecessary features.
    Scale numerical features using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.

Phase 3: Model Training & Evaluation
  Step 6: Choose Baseline Models

    Start with Logistic Regression & Decision Tree.
  
  Step 7: Improve Model Performance

    Try Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
    Perform Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV.

  Step 8: Evaluate Model Performance

    Use Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC Curve.
    Focus on Recall, since missing fraud cases is more costly than false positives.

Phase 4: Model Deployment
  Step 9: Convert the Model into an API

    Use Flask or FastAPI to serve predictions.

  Step 10: Build a Simple Web Interface

    Use Streamlit to create a fraud detection app.

  Step 11: Deploy the Model

Deploy on Streamlit.

Phase 5: Final Touches

Step 12: Create a GitHub Repository

Summarize your project for visibility.
